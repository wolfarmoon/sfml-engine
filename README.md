# SFML Engine
This is not actually a game engine. I may add some features i consider helpful for developing basic sfml games.
## Can I use it?
Actually not. This project is tuned for personal use in **my** SFML projects **only** and may change **a lot** from one day to another. But you can use any class of this project, just credit me.

## But how do i use it?
This is the way i am doing it: Add this repo as a submodule to your project. Then, from CMake, add it as a directory. Also add the includes.
